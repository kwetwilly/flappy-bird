# Flappy Bird
*Fundamentals of Computing I*

### Introduction
Back in sophomore year, my friend and I re-created the popular mobile game, Flappy Bird, in C using a simple graphics library provided by our professor.

This was the first major project I was involved in as a student. This was also my first semester of knowing how to code, as we learned C in that Fundamentals class.

### Gameplay
Just like the mobile game, the object of this version of Flappy Bird is to flap the bird sprite between the two green pipes. When the player successfully flaps through the gap in the pipes, the player earns a point.  The player's high score during the session is kept, and after reaching a certain high score, the bird sprite will change color.

- **Space Bar:** Invoke Flap
- **R Key:** Restart the Game
- **Q Key:** Quite the Game

### Dependencies
This project's simple graphics library requires [XQuartx](https://www.xquartz.org/) in order to play
